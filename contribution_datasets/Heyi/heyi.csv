heyi,"Sand partridges are endemic across the Middle East. Populations are distributed across Eastern Egypt, Eastern Sudan, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The four subspecies of the sand partridge are native to specific parts of the Middle East.","sand, ref, ebird"
heyi,"The Ammoperdix heyi heyi is distributed from the Jordan Valley to the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula to Saudi Arabia. The Ammopredix heyi nicolli is distributed across Northern Egypt. The Ammoperdix heyo cholmleyi is distributed from Egypt to Northern Sudan. The Ammoperdix heyi intermedius is distributed from Western Saudi Arabia to Yemen east into Oman and to the Musandam Peninsula in the UAE. Sand partridges can be found in desert ecosystems with scattered vegetation and boulders. They prefer steep, boulder-strewn slopes with sandy-bottomed wadis and ridges up to 2000 m and valleys down to 400 m below sea level. Sand partridges are rarely found in large stretches of dry, flat, or open desert as they require a water source for drinking. The sand partridge is non-migratory, so it breeds and spends its year in these habitats. Known vocalizations only for male sand partridges.","ref, name, heyi"
heyi,"Male's signalling call is a ""kew-kew-kew"" or ""watcha-watcha-watcha"".","kew, watcha, male"

heyi,Sand partridges are Omnivore birds.,"diet, sand, partridges"
heyi,"They feed on a mixed diet of plant matter and insects. During the summer, the sand partridge forages mostly for seeds and berries. Seeds come mostly from Acacia","ref, name, mostly"
heyi,and grasses. Berries come mostly from the toothbrush tree/mustard tree (Salvadora persica) and myrrhs ([[CommiphoraCommiphora spp.,"ref, name, tree"
heyi,"]]). Insects are mostly locusts. In Arabian Peninsula specifically, sand partridges eat leaves and buds of desert thorn (Lycium shawii), Rhazya stricta and Sideroxylon mascatense.","ref, name, insects"
heyi,"Habitats with woody vegetation height of 2–3 m between rocks are ideal foraging grounds for the sand partridge, as it provides food and also sufficient shelter from predator attacks. Breeding seasons are dependent on location.","ref, name, habitats"
heyi,"In Israel, sand partridges breed between February and August. Sand partridges are probably Monogamy in animals birds, but nests have been seen merely 30–70 m apart in Israel, indicating one male mating with multiple females (see Polygyny in animals). Nests are built in three different fashions.","ref, name, sand"
heyi,"One way is the sand partridge will sparsely line the nest with grass, feathers, bits of wood, or pebbles. The second way is the sand partridge will build the nest under the cover of bush or rock and leave the nest unlined. The third way is building the nest in hollows or crevices at the base of cliffs. Females lay between 5–14 eggs that are pale grey or pink. Two females may lay in the same nest. Incubation is by females only for around 21–24 days. Chicks are white with grey upper breast and pale throat. Chicks become fledges at 9–20 days, and then are full grown at 30 days. Sand partridges can be found in groups of dozens of members, but families may come together to form large Flock (birds) of up to 70 members in later summer/early autumn. The sand partridge is listed as 'Least Concern' by the IUCN Red List. Releasing sand partridges to supplement hunted birds is part of their conservation work. * [https://www.oiseaux.net/birds/sand.partridge.html Oiseaux.net] on the sand partridge * [https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/species.jsp?","ref, name, sand"
